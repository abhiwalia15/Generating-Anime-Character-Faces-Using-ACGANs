# Generating-Anime-Character-Faces-Using-ACGANs
Abstract-This paper will implement a baseline Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Network capable of generating new anime character faces. We aim to design a style-guided discriminator and a generator network and train it on 63,000 synthesized anime faces. ACGANs can be notoriously hard to train as the generator, and the discriminator architectures are susceptible to parameters, hyperparameters, regularization, learning rate, and activation functions. However, unlike a conventional GANs network, our proposed framework uses a GPU for faster training and can improve its performance given more c- omputational power and datasets. This problem has previously been solved but lacks a generic architecture. Hence, our proposed framework can be used as a baseline network across different applications of GANs. The generated anime faces from our final model are visually pleasing and resemble designer-generated characters. As generative modelling is an unsupervised task and does not expect images to have labels, the dataset used in this project has 63,000 unlabeled cropped anime faces available at this URL: https://github.com/bchao1/Anime-Face-Dataset.
